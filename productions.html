                <p><strong>BLACK BALLERINA</strong> (IN PRODUCTION; 60:00), a feature length documentary-in-progress, is a story of passion, opportunity, heartbreak and triumph of the human spirit. Set in the overwhelmingly white world of classical dance, it tells the stories of several black women from different generations who fell in love with ballet. Six decades ago, while pursuing their dreams of careers in classical dance, Joan Myers Brown, Delores Browne and Raven Wilkinson confronted racism, exclusion and unequal opportunity. In 2014, three young black women also pursue careers as ballerinas. Do they find that the color of ballet has changed? If so, how? If not, why?<br>
BLACK BALLERINA uses the ethereal world of ballet to engage viewers in a subject that reaches far outside the art world. Through broadcast and a comprehensive educational and community outreach initiative, BLACK BALLERINA compels viewers to think about larger issues of exclusion, equal opportunity and change.

				<p><strong>STRATHMERE </strong>(IN PRODUCTION; 60:00) tells the story of a small New Jersey fishing and vacation town on the cusp of irrevocable change. Through the mid-2000s, soaring property values, skyrocketing taxes and a shrinking year-round population had increasingly endangered this fragile barrier island community. By 2008, severe environmental changes in the form of major beach erosion have further jeopardized Strathmere. Fighting for its survival, residents reveal their passion for the island, while viewers come to understand the value of such places to the human spirit. In January 2009, a short version of the documentary appeared on WYBE-TV (Independence Public Media) as part of the station’s PHILADELPHIA STORIES series. STRATHMERE is being co-produced/co-directed by Frances McElroy and Ann Tegnell. Funders so far include the Philadelphia Foundation. </p>
